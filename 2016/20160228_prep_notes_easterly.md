# Political Neutrality 
  * Development is not about politics. It can be done through neutral
  technical interventions. We just need technical solutions to
  technical problems. 
  * Example: There is malaria. Spray the mosquitoes.
  * Counterexample. There is CO2. Let's plant trees. [Displace people
