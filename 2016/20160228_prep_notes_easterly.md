Preparatory notes to discuss the points raised by [Bill Easterly](http://williameasterly.org/) presenting [Tiranny of Experts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEFEmwp7NO8)

Three main blind spots / myths

# Political Neutrality 
  * Mith. Development is not about politics. It can be done through neutral
  technical interventions. We just need technical solutions to
  technical problems. 
  * Truth. Development should also include the
   people's right to make the political and economic authorities
   accountable.
  * Example: There is malaria. Spray the mosquitoes.
  * Counterexample. There is CO2. Let's plant trees. [Displace people
  in Uganda to do
  it - sponsored by the World Bank.](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/sep/22/uganda-farmer-land-gave-me-everything). 
  World Bank never investigated

  * Counterexample. [Bill Gates praising Ethiopia's Meles
   Zenawi](http://hornaffairs.com/en/2012/05/10/bill-gates-writes-praising-ethiopias-leadership-and-progress/)
   who has been critized by [Human Rights
   Watch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meles_Zenawi#Criticism_and_scandals). 
  
# Poverty is about a shortage of experts 
  * Mith. Poverty is about a shortage of experts 
  * Truth. Poverty is about a shortage of freedom.
  * Colonialists also pushed this myth.
  * Segregationists also pushed this myth. "Black people should focus
  on economic progress and leave second equality of rights"

# Action plans lead to action
  * Mith. Top-down expert plans can lead to effective action.
  * Truth. Ideals movilize forces for change. 
  * Example. The civil right movements did not had a plan designed by
  expertes. Marthin Luther King didn't say "I have a plan".
  * People need to care first, then they engage into action. They
  develop the needed tools. 
  * A call to action should be in fact a call for ideals.
