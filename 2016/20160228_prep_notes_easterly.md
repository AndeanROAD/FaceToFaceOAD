Preparatory notes to discuss the points raised by [Bill Easterly](http://williameasterly.org/) presenting [Tiranny of Experts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEFEmwp7NO8)

Three main blind spots / myths

# Political Neutrality 
  * Mith. Development is not about politics. It can be done through neutral
  technical interventions. We just need technical solutions to
  technical problems. 
  * Truth. Development should also include the
   people's right to make the political and economic authorities
   accountable.
  * Example: There is malaria. Spray the mosquitoes.
  * Counterexample. There is CO2. Let's plant trees. [Displace people
  in Uganda to do
  it - sponsored by the World Bank.](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/sep/22/uganda-farmer-land-gave-me-everything). 
  World Bank never investigated

  * Counterexample. [Bill Gates praising Ethiopia's Meles
   Zenawi](http://hornaffairs.com/en/2012/05/10/bill-gates-writes-praising-ethiopias-leadership-and-progress/)
   who has been critized by [Human Rights
   Watch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meles_Zenawi#Criticism_and_scandals). 
  
# Poverty is about a shortage of experts 
  * Mith. Poverty is about a shortage of experts 
  * Truth. Poverty is about a shortage of freedom.
  * Colonialists also pushed this myth.
  * Segregationists also pushed this myth. "Black people should focus
  on economic progress and leave second equality of rights"

# Action plans lead to action
  * Mith. Top-down expert plans can lead to effective action.
  * Truth. Ideals movilize forces for change. 
  * Example. The civil right movements did not had a plan designed by
  expertes. Marthin Luther King didn't say "I have a plan".
  * People need to care first, then they engage into action. They
  develop the needed tools. 
  * A call to action should be in fact a call for ideals.

# Smart scientific solutions vs. dumb solution finding systems

* Three aspects of knowledge. Cost. Context. Consternation.

* Cost. Not about cost/benefit analysis of research. We just do the
  research. But expert scientific knowledge is expensive. It takes
  time to create an expert.  Basic principle economize in the
  expensive - use the extensively the cheap. In development studies we
  do the opposite. Can you escale something that uses an expensive resource?
  Can we have an entire solution system based on randomize control
  trials which are intensive in the use of money and experts?

  Example: My doctor uses expensive scientific knowldge. But I choose
  a doctor because he is my friend's doctor.
  Example: Entepreneurship. They are smart enough to use dumb finding
  solution system. See what the customer like.
