## Updates from OAO

- "To support using astronomy as a tool for development, the OAO provides access to information, resources..."
- Late summer: APRIM (Asia Pacific) 1 h for A4D discussion - needs feedback from regions
- Successful stories for IAU 100th anniversary - OAD spotlight
- NOC (outreach contacts) seeks to reach countries outside of ROADs
- CAP - Grants are limited - find funds for regional nodes to attend
- **Action**: find NOC in regions and communicate with OAO to sync
- **Action**: Send Ram names of TF members.

## ROADs presence at IAU meetings

- Try to arrange F2F meetings so they take place at RIMs

## Overlapping countries in ROADs

- PLOAD: Mozambique and East Timor are in other ROADs
- Protocol for ROADs interaction

## Communications

- OAD has communications framework for project communications (social media sharing through OAO and OAD)
- ROADs should have minimum common framework as well (social media presence)
- Common information hub for key information
- Astronomy Translation Network (NAOJ, OAO, OAD)
- Suggestion: use Slack for quick communications in order to not flood emails

## Countries outside ROADs

- North America - Europe - Oceania
- ROADs are the global coordinators for the world, not OAD (global management team)
- Business plan: Consolidate instead of forming new offices - open discussion

- All members can vote in scientific matters
- Executive commitee can decide whether a member changes category (up- or downgrade)

## IAU strategic plan

- Lack of effective communication of the importance of Astronomy beyond entertainment value
- NASA vs. IAU in terms of reputation
- IAU can help give OAD a good standing with development-related funding agencies
- **Action**: Socialize the document with regions, consolidate input and get back to OAD before Mid-June (23rd)
- Ewine suggested creating an OAD fundraising brochure by the end of June
- **Action**: Wishlist for 1k to 1m ideas

## Funding strategies

- Involvement of many ROADs for open calls (Horizon 2020, Silk Road)
- IAU is hiring someone for OAD fundraising
- Create an OAD commission for funding from all coordinators - liason with IAU (purely stratgic)
    - Prospery, Sona, Rosa, Vanessa, Kevin, someone from East Asia
    - Until IAU hire, communication will remain open

## IAU General Assembly

- 5 1/2 h allocated time for OAD session
- Give priority to ROADs panel, Synergies, Fundraising, 
- Branding for OAD @ GA
- Reaching out to Astronomy and Inclusion sessions and groups
- Prepare content (well written bits) for IAU newspaper

## Review of ROADs

- Reviews will take place before end of terms. IAU will assume that agreements continue until review (even after term ends)
- Reviews will set up new agreements
- Review from other ROADs - peer review can be helpful, but is not independent
- **Action**: Send feedback about review document - terms of agreement? Less than four years?
- Set up timeline with Kevin

## Combine business plan

- Period for CBP structure review - once per F2F meeting
- Standardize how information is presented - achievements, indicators at F2F meetings
- **Action**: Review ROAD plan for next F2F meeting by August (two months)
